# About

Demonizer is a vertical shooter in the early to mid 90s arcade style of Raiden Fighters and Battle Garegga.

In a cartoon fantasy land, an exiled princess has turned into a demon  and joined the peaceful monster-girl tribe. When her former kingdom  attacks she fights back with her newfound hypnotic and transformative  powers. She departs for the king's throne room where she will confront  her father and bring the invasion to an end.

Survive the waves of advancing human soldiers and capture as many of  them as you can. Fire magic stun lasers and bombs to defend yourself and  save your monster-girl friends, then catch the unconscious enemies  before they fall offscreen. Some you keep to harvest their spirit  energy. Others you transform into sister demons who fight by your side.  As you gather more spirit energy, you refill your bomb supply and unlock  additional powers to grab enemies from afar.
